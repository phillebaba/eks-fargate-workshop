# Setup
Before starting you need to make sure that you have installed the following dependencies. They will be used throughout the workshop.
* [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases) (>=0.11.0)
* [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html)
* [kubectl](https://v1-13.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl)

Start off by cloning this repository as you will need to give file paths to commands that you will execute.
```shell
git clone github.com
```

Now that you have cloned the repository you get on with the workshop. This workshop is divided into chapters to make it easier to follow along. Some of the chapters will depend on reources created in others so make sure that you delete anything unless explicitly told so.
